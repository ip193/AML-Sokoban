SSRL_49_shallow - Shallow network trained with the exact algorithm and architecture from the paper. 


SSRL_4_shallowCartPole - (start_at_1=False, use_special_binary_output=True)

DEEPSSRL_4_10_10_deepCartPole_1_out - (nonlinearity=torch.tanh, start_at_1=False, use_special_binary_output=True,
                   use_abs_chi=True, use_abs_val_of_grad=True)  (This is wrong because I didn't use the last tanh activation)
